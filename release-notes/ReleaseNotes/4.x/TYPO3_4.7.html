<h1 id="typo3-4.7-release-notes">TYPO3 4.7 Release Notes</h1>
<p>This document contains information about TYPO3 version 4.7 which was released on April 24th 2012 <a href="https://forge.typo3.org/projects/typo3v47-projects/wiki">Roadmap</a></p>
<h2 id="system-requirements">System Requirements</h2>
<p>The system requirements are <strong>NOT</strong> the same as for TYPO3 4.5, but equal to TYPO3 4.6:</p>
<ul>
<li>PHP 5.3.x</li>
<li>MySQL 5.0.x-5.1.x</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="installing">Installing</h2>
<h3 id="upgrading">Upgrading</h3>
<p>Download the packages from the <a href="https://typo3.org/download/">download package page at typo3.org</a>.</p>
<p>To upgrade an existing installation of to 4.7, please follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>check your deprecation log if you are using deprecated stuff, which might be removed in 4.7</li>
<li>check if you use XHTML frontend output with a special condition for IE6 using xmlprologue = none: see Upgrading issues</li>
<li><strong>check you database if it is utf-8 encoded - TYPO3 4.7 only will work with utf-8</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>There will be a converter script by the time of the final release, which is kindly provided by Jigal van Hemert</p>
<ul>
<li>link the new sources from TYPO3</li>
<li>edit your localconf file if you have settings for setDBinit or forceCharset on settings any other than utf-8
<ul>
<li>remove the line $TYPO3_CONF_VARS['BE']['forceCharset']</li>
<li>remove the line $TYPO3_CONF_VARS['SYS']['setDBinit']</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Visit the Install Tool:
<ul>
<li>Run through “Update wizards” which are new in 4.6 (you can now go through them using the “Next” button)</li>
<li>Use the “Database COMPARE” section and apply all database schema changes</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="upgrading-issues">Upgrading issues</h4>
<ul>
<li>If you get an exception telling that a class could not be found, consider clearing the autoloader cache manually. To do so, delete the folder typo3temp/Cache/code/php_code.</li>
<li>If the backend stays “white” on login, if you have about and about modules installed, but missed to install extbase and fluid</li>
<li>If you are working with “config.xmlprologue = none” to get IE6 using standards mode on XHTML webpage output, this as of now will disable XHTML cleaning. There is an extra option for this purpose called “config.doctype_switch”, which switches XML and Doctype declaration which enables IE6 to be used in standard mode, too. Please use this one instead.</li>
<li>In case you have extensions that restructured the TypoScript Code of CSS Styled Content to adapt output rendering or customized it yourself, you might encounter a weird frontend-output. This is due to an overworked CSS Styled Content Frontend Rendering. Please contact the extension owner to adapt his extension, and get in contact with us via Twitter, Newsgroup or steffen.ritter@typo3.org to create a list of incompatible extensions. <strong>Most likely some Lightbox-Extensions will break.</strong></li>
<li>Be aware, that the old HTML-Mailing Engine, which has been included in TYPO3 for many years finally got removed. Many Extensions may rely on that and therefore throw an ClassNotFound Exception. In that cacse, please contact the extension owner to adapt his extension and get in contact with us via Twitter, Newsgroup or steffen.ritter@typo3.org to extend the list of incompatible extensions.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="new-installations">New installations</h3>
<p>Try out the <strong>introduction package</strong> which provides a very easy way of installing TYPO3 and having some example setup already in place. In addition starting as of TYPO3 4.7 there will be an additional <strong>government package</strong> aiming to tackle the issues governmental or public organisations have to deal while creating websites. Currently this government package is only available in german.</p>
<h1 id="changes-and-improvements">Changes and improvements</h1>
<p>This will list all changes and improvements between TYPO3 4.6 and 4.7. For technical details see ChangeLog included in the typo3_src package or the end of the page.</p>
<h3 id="html5-frontend-rendering">HTML5 frontend rendering</h3>
<p>One of the biggest steps forward in modern content-rendering and accessibility is the HTML5 standard. Thanks to the sponsoring received from the “Bundesanstalt für Landwirtschaft und Ernährung” we were able to refactor and enhance TYPO3's content rendering (CSS Styled Content) in order to generate clean, valid, and accessible output. In more than 40 single tasks, CSS Styled Content has been enabled to produce non-XML HTML code, which also re-enables TYPO3 to generate clean HTML 4.0. Within CSS Styled Content for example image rendering, table rendering, as well as semantically annotated headlines and menus or sitemaps got reworked. For further information about general accessibility and its usage within TYPO3, see the “Accessibility Documentation”[1] which also has been created with thankful sponsoring from the BLE.</p>
<h3 id="general">General</h3>
<ul>
<li>For TYPO3 version 4.7, we upgraded two external libraries. By raising SwiftMailer API to version 4.1.3[2] we brought more possibilities for email handling to you.Furthermore ADOdb was updated to version 5.14[3]. This version now also supports the native MSSQL driver for Linux, which brings improved performance for MSSQL + DBAL users.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>The forceCharset option has been deprecated in version 4.5. UTF-8 is now enforced. Even though other values than “utf-8” have not been possible anymore for some time, the option's value has been queried at plenty of places within the whole core. These references, the option in the Install Tool, as well as many defaults with charset “iso-8859-1” in several classes have been changed, so TYPO3 now works UTF-8-only internally.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>The Backend modules “about” and “aboutmodules” have been migrated to Extbase in order to show, how to build simple backend modules with extbase and in addition to clean up the codebase.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="backend-backend-ui">Backend / Backend UI</h3>
<ul>
<li>Many small fixes have been applied to the Backend UI, in order to streamline Backend modules not following or implementing the concepts the TYPO3 UX/UI team. In addition there have been some usability improvements in admin related parts of the Backend.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Editors uploading data within TCEforms will be pleased that the HTML5 multi-upload feature has been implemented for file uploads.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Editors will see the same “root” of the page tree like admins. The TYPO3 soul has been placed as id 0 on the top of the editor's mount points. This especially enables editors working in workspaces to see all changes across all mount points when klicking on the tree-root.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>In addition TYPO3 does now support an additional backend language: Afrikaans. The new language is available on the translation server and needs your help getting core and extensions translated.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="htmlarea-rich-text-editor">htmlArea Rich-Text-Editor</h3>
<p>As the RTE is the main entry point for editors bringing their content to the user, the RTE has undergone many improvements. Especially to support the many great possibilities HTML5 offers, htmlArea RTE has been extended. The custom attributes used by the RTE internally handle some states now HTML5 compliant using the data-* attributes. In the same matter, the RTE preserves the data-* micro data attributes, if entered by the editor. Further possibilities like a button to insert a soft-hyphen to predefine a line-break, as well as configuration options for the “Insert image” dialog have been integrated to grant a greater and more individual experience to the editor.</p>
<h3 id="security">Security</h3>
<p>The authentication service chain has been overworked to detach secure password transmission via the system extension rsaauth from the actual authentication. As a result, auth-services do not need to instantiate and call rsaauth themselves anymore, but can directly access the already decoded plain-password.</p>
<h3 id="typoscript-frontend">TypoScript / Frontend</h3>
<p>Attempting to yield a better experience new possibilities have been introduced helping integrators to fulfill their daily tasks. For those using the default page title mechanism (outputted in the</p>
<title>
<p>tag) the separation char “:” can now be customized via TypoScript. The mighty stdWrap construct has been extended to be more flexible, too. On one hand you now can execute multiple stdWrap runs in a pre-defined order on the same object. Furthermore new places got stdWrap-enabled. Looking at the details you will find more small enhancements like configurable icons of file-links, http-equiv meta-tags, and others.</p>
<h3 id="system-extension-frontend-login">System Extension “Frontend Login”</h3>
<p>The system extension “felogin” acting as a central point for building closed user-groups got enhanced with new features. Due to many new stdWrap possibilities and template markers, integrators have more flexible possibilities to customize the look and feel of felogin. If you ever worried about the password-forgot email send out to the user, a new hook now enables you to adapt and customize the message and its subject. Furthermore you may provide a better experience to your users, as you can enable a feature that discloses whether the username or password was incorrect (instead of just showing that something went wrong). More detailed information can be found in the updated felogin extension's manual.</p>
<h3 id="development">Development</h3>
<p>Several new improvements for developers have been added: Starting from new hooks, new TCA options, or an additional way to create <a href="Extension_Development,_native_ExtJS_Modules" title="wikilink">backend modules as ExtJS cards</a> to new interfaces and classes for collection handling have been integrated. A detailed overview over all these possibilities will be published on wiki.typo3.org soon.</p>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p>The TYPO3 default search engine “indexed_search” could run into massive performance issues on bigger sites. TYPO3 4.7 ships with an addition to indexed_search which allows using MySQL full text index natively resulting in a massive performance boost. Tagging of TypoScript elements via stdWrap is now possible, too. As a result, these tags are added to the page-cache and TCEmain.clearCacheCmd is enabled to drop page cache by these tags. This allows to set up versatile and performing caching behavior for high-performance websites.</p>
<h3 id="cleanup">Cleanup</h3>
<p>As the community always aims to clean up the old code base step by step many improvements have been introduced in version 4.7. As always deprecated code has been removed. In addition old references to extensions were removed and unused classes and files were deleted.</p>
<h3 id="bugs">Bugs</h3>
<p>Besides all the amazing new stuff already about 200 bugs have been fixed since the release of 4.6 in October 2011.</p>
